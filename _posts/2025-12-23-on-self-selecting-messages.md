# Introduction

I recently revisted a delightful article by Douglas Hofstadter in one of his articles in his collection "Metamagical Themas" on self-reference. He goes over a variety of tricky sentences that bend the mind like the liar paradox: "I am lying". If one thinks about this, one quickly realizes that the sentence seems to flip back and forth between being true and false. I appreciated how he compiles a large variety of sentences and provides many different variations.

I realized that I have a similar category of funny sentences that for lack of a better term I have titled `Self-Selecting Messages`. To jump into an example, you might have ran into bumper stickers on cars like the following...

```If you can read this... you are driving too close!```

This message is self-selecting in the sense that the only people who need to read it are those that can read it. These sentences become particularly intereseting when there is a connection between what the message and those that the message self-selects. Another self-selecting bumpersticker I found online states...

```¡ɹǝʌo ǝɯ dᴉlɟ uǝɥʇ 'sᴉɥʇ pɐǝɹ uɐɔ noʎ ɟI```

I began to think about what other types of self-selecting messages might exist and what uses they may have. I came up with a few main classes.

# Selecting for Linguistic Understanding

First, one can encode a message in a way that exposes the fact that the reader could understand the sentence at all. It could be as simple as using another language...

```¡Puedes leer Español!```

Or similarly...

```You can read English!```

Or even just...

```You can read!```

One might also use other special encodings such as...

```Fvb ohcl avv tbjo aptl vu fvby ohukz!```

One might also be able to play into one's ability to read even when the letters are messed up such as in the [Transposed Letter Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposed_letter_effect)

```You pborlaby dno't hvae dxlseyia if you can raed tihs!```

...this might be inaccurate and I need to test it.

Each of these examples is rather silly in themselves but they show the potential for self-selecting listeners based on how you communicate the message. For example, if one wanted to collect all speakers in a room that speak a specific language, all you need to do is make the request in that language and the listeners will self-select.

More extreme examples might be signs at a blind person's convention or an audio track for those at a deaf conference. While this does target those with disabilities, those who have a lose of a primary sense can also self-select through the use of braile or ASL.

The potential for self-selecting messages extends beyond merely understanding the sentence. One can also play into whether the conditions under which a person would even notice the message in the first place.

# Selecting for Spatial Location 

One I thought of when I was younger was that if I arrived back home but wasn't sure if anyone else was there, there really isn't any consequences for shouting: "IS ANYONE HERE?". Either no one is there and thus doesn't care that I yelled or someone does here my question making it legitimate! 

Another fun idea is to use volume as a mechanism. One might quietly whisper...

```If you can hear this, then you are standing too close```

Or to play off of one of the bumper stickers from earlier. One could put up this sign at an art gallery with small text...

```If you can read this, then you are too close to the art piece.```

# Selecting for Understanding

Or one might also consider how familiar one is with certain words such as...

```Did you know gullible isn't in the dictionary?```

Or abilities such as...

```There are two types of people in the world. Those who can extrapolate from incomplete data.```

Or understanding certain concepts such as...

```There are 10 types of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who do not.```


# Selecting for Character

One might also construct a message so that it is difficult to decode so that those who manage to understand it anyway have demonstrated the trait of perseverance. One could also hide a message somewhere and let those who find it know that they are far too curious!

Making certain messages difficult or obscure can select the message for those who truly care about it. The person of Jesus seems to have been doing this type of self-selection by choosing to speak in parables instead of directly.

> The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”
>
> He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
>
> *Matthew 13:11-12*


In the field of cybersecurity, one might setup a [Honey Pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)). These are resources that no normal user would access on a website except for a malicious one. If you are trying to access `/admin` when the real admin link is `/true_admin`, then you are probably a hacker! Such users can then be quickly flagged as potential threats to a website.

# Self-Regulating Messages

A final interesting extension is on what might be called `Self-Regulating Messages`. These would be a combination of two or more self-regulating messages working together to bring the reader into a specific state. One could use the [Hybrid Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_image) illusion to bring the reader within a specified distance from the message.

_A Message that Self-Regulates the Distance_

One might also imagine a similar effect with an audio track that has different messages depending on the speed. Setting the faster speed message to "Too Slow" and the slower one to "Too Fast" could bring the listener to adjust the speed within a certain range.

# Self-Selecting Physical Objects

There is also cases where one can imagine tangiable objects that have intended or unintended selection effects.

![Scissors](/assets/img/scissors.png){: width="300" height="100" }
_How would you open this package? Who exactly is the intended purchaser?_
