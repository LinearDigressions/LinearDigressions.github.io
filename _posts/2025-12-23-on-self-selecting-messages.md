# Introduction

I recently revisted a delightful article by Douglas Hofstadter in his collection "Metamagical Themas" on self-reference. He goes over a variety of tricky self-referencing sentences like the liar paradox: "I am lying". One quickly realizes this sentence flips back and forth between being true and false. This got me thinking about other categories of interesting sentences.

I quickly identified a new group funny sentences that for lack of a better term I have titled `Self-Selecting Messages`. To jump into an example, you might have ran into bumper stickers on cars like the following...

```If you can read this... you are driving too close!```

Another self-selecting bumpersticker I found online states...

```¡ɹǝʌo ǝɯ dᴉlɟ uǝɥʇ 'sᴉɥʇ pɐǝɹ uɐɔ noʎ ɟI```

These messages are self-selecting because only people who need to read them are those that can read them. Furthermore, the messages are related to the conditions needed to read them in the first place. Whereas in self-referring sentences, the sentence points back at itself, self-selecting sentences point back at the interpreter. It is almost as if these sentences know that they are being watched.

What these types of sentences made me realize, is that the reader is not as anonymous as one might think. Normally, if I am reading a book or an article, I can learn quite a bit about the author depending on what they write. What goes unnoticed is that the author can also know quite a bit about their readers as well. Obviously, the author cannot know exactly who will read their work. However, if someone is reading a book, then the author can make some reasonable inferences about that reader. If the author ever finds out someone has read their book, then the author can immediately know several things about that person. The first level of `Self-Selecting Messages` is merely higlighting these facts.

# Did you know you can read?

At the most basic level, a `Self-Selecting Message` can point out the conditions that must be true in order for someone to understand the sentence.

They can be as trivial as...

```You can see!```

```You can read!```

```You can read English!```

But if we use another language...

```¡Puedes leer Español!```

And by combining the last two...

```¡Eres bilingüe!```

Already, by writing in Spanish on an English primary blog, I write messages that self-select for only those who are billingual.

One might also be able to play into one's ability to read even when the letters are messed up such as in the [Transposed Letter Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposed_letter_effect)

```You pborlaby dno't hvae dxlseyia if you can raed tihs!```

...this might be inaccurate.

There are also some I can add by virtue of this article being on a blog...

```You are looking at a screen!```

```You are have access to the internet!```

```You are using a computer!```

<details>
  <summary>Click Here</summary>
  <code>You clicked the button!</code>
</details>
<p></p>

<div class="mobile-only">
This content only shows on mobile.
</div>

And by virtue of the fact that this blog is a small scale effort.

```You probably know James Boyer personally!```

One might also use other special encodings such as...

```Fvb ohcl avv tbjo aptl vu fvby ohukz!```




Each of these examples is rather silly in themselves but they show the potential for self-selecting listeners based on how you communicate the message. For example, if one wanted to collect all speakers in a room that speak a specific language, all you need to do is make the request in that language and the listeners will self-select.

More extreme examples might be signs at a blind person's convention or an audio track for those at a deaf conference. While this does target those with disabilities, those who have a lose of a primary sense can also self-select through the use of braile or ASL.

The potential for self-selecting messages extends beyond merely understanding the sentence. One can also play into whether the conditions under which a person would even notice the message in the first place.

# Selecting for Spatial Location 

One I thought of when I was younger was that if I arrived back home but wasn't sure if anyone else was there, there really isn't any consequences for shouting: "IS ANYONE HERE?". Either no one is there and thus doesn't care that I yelled or someone does here my question making it legitimate! 

Another fun idea is to use volume as a mechanism. One might quietly whisper...

```If you can hear this, then you are standing too close```

Or to play off of one of the bumper stickers from earlier. One could put up this sign at an art gallery with small text...

```If you can read this, then you are too close to the art piece.```

# Selecting for Understanding

Or one might also consider how familiar one is with certain words such as...

```Did you know gullible isn't in the dictionary?```

Or abilities such as...

```There are two types of people in the world. Those who can extrapolate from incomplete data.```

Or understanding certain concepts such as...

```There are 10 types of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who do not.```


# Selecting for Character

One might construct a message that is self-selecting for a certain type of person. Imagine an online test advertising...

```Click here to find out if you are insecure!```

This is one that I would certainly be tempted to click. I think though that the automatic answer to clicking on a test should be no. Similarly, would you consider...

```Pay $20 to find out if you are good with money!```

Or be pulled into...

 ```Take this 100 question quiz to find out if you are good with time managment!```

Or perhaps most tempting of all...

```Spend 5 minutes to definitively find out if you can resist online quizes!```

In the field of cybersecurity, one might setup a [Honey Pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)). These are resources that no normal user would access on a website except for a malicious one. If you are trying to access `/admin` when the real admin link is `/true_admin`, then you are probably a hacker! Such users can then be quickly flagged as potential threats to a website.

# Self-Regulating Messages

A final interesting extension is on what might be called `Self-Regulating Messages`. These would be a combination of two or more self-regulating messages working together to bring the reader into a specific state. One could use the [Hybrid Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_image) illusion to bring the reader within a specified distance from the message.

_A Message that Self-Regulates the Distance_

One might also imagine a similar effect with an audio track that has different messages depending on the speed. Setting the faster speed message to "Too Slow" and the slower one to "Too Fast" could bring the listener to adjust the speed within a certain range.

# Self-Selecting Physical Objects

There is also cases where one can imagine tangiable objects that have intended or unintended selection effects.

![Scissors](/assets/img/scissors.png){: width="300" height="100" }
_How would you open this package? Who exactly is the intended purchaser?_
